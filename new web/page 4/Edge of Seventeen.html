                <p class="lead">Hailee Steinfeld is so talented. I've watched this movie approximately 12398493 times because of her. I identify with this movie so strongly even though my best friend never slept with my brother.</p>
                <p>In the grand scheme of things, losing a trusted friendship is a painful blow, but it usually isn’t the end of the world. If you’re an unpopular teenager, however, and the interloper is a sibling, it can feel like that.

The personal nightmare of Nadine (Hailee Steinfeld), the embattled heroine of Kelly Fremon Craig’s smart, achingly bittersweet comedy, “The Edge of Seventeen” begins the night of a sleepover with her only close friend, Krista (Haley Lu Richardson), whom she catches in bed with her older brother, Darian (Blake Jenner, of “Everybody Wants Some!!”). Because Darian is the high school golden boy who could have anyone he wants, the discovery feels like a betrayal as sharp as a knife in the heart.

After a cursory attempt at harmony in which the sweethearts invite Nadine to join them at a party, then abandon her to play beer pong, she insists Krista choose between them. When Krista refuses, Nadine banishes her from her life and spends much of the rest of the movie in a state of acute anguish and rage.</p>
